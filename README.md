# 🎨 Digital Art Portraits

## ✨ Description

Welcome to the **Digital Art Portraits** project, an artistic exploration of the fusion between art and artificial intelligence. This project showcases a collection of unique portraits generated using Stable Diffusion, an advanced AI model. These portraits feature my fellow artists from the Master’s program in Digital Art at the Federal University of the Far East.

### 🌟 Project Overview

During my time at the Federal University of the Far East, I had the privilege of working with a group of exceptionally talented artists. To celebrate our creative journey and to delve into the potential of AI in art, I created this project. Each portrait, generated through Stable Diffusion, captures the unique essence of the artists and highlights the innovative capabilities of AI in creating captivating visuals.
